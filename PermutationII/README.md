# String Permutation II

## Description

Given a list of numbers with duplicate number in it. Find all unique permutations.

### Example

For numbers [1,2,2] the unique permutations are:

[

  [1,2,2],
  
  [2,1,2],
  
  [2,2,1]

]


Using recursion to do it is acceptable. If you can do it without recursion, that would be great!
