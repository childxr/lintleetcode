# Combinations

## Description

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.

You don't need to care the order of combinations, but you should make sure the numbers in a combination are sorted.


### Example

Given n = 4 and k = 2, a solution is:

[
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4]
]
